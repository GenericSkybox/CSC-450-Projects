The main program is NetworkTestScript.sh

In order to run it, type "./NetworkTestScript.sh" into a Ubuntu shell
However, in order to run it properly, you need python 3.6 (or perhaps just a version of Python3) installed already
Also, you need "speedtest-cli" installed; which is a Python program you can grab from pip
